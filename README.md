# Improving Data Integration Quality for Multi-Source Analytics

This project was built for IBM Internship Course for AI and Data Quality Analysis.

It focuses on enhancing the quality of data integration processes for multi- source analytics. By addressing data inconsistencies, improving data accuracy, and  streamlining data pipelines, we aim to deliver high-quality data for informed decision-making.

In this project we have used three datasets of different attributes obtained from multiple sources. These can be merged and compared based on the same attribute values in a particular field.
The project is divided into four phases and each phase has an document with a detailed flow of our project.
